### Application Protocol

- message format & type
  - HTTP request
  - HTTP response
- event handling
- PORT #

### HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

-> Port # = 80

Assume Client/Server model

Server name ---DNS---> IP address  
HTTP server listens on port 80

Client initiate connection

- application create a socket to transport layer and uses TCP for reliability
- delivers in-order packets
- port number has to be defined by the application layer protocol

Server's port number has to be 80 because it should be well known

- implies client can use any port number

### HTTP Request

```
GET (URL that is requesting) (URL - uniform resource locater)
header line - xyz.com/index.html (object URL)
Host: www.xyz.com
(can have many header lines)
------
Entity body: DATA
```

### HTTP response

```
HTTP/ 200(status code)  - (status line)
Date of retrival
Content length: number of bytes in the entity
Content type: HTML/Text etc.
------
Entity body: DATA
```

#### HTTP Status codes:

- 1xx 2xx successful
- 3xx redirection
- 4xx client error - error in the request
- 5xx server error

### Client

- initiates TCP connection on port number 80  
  (TCP: 3-way handshake)

### RTT - round trip time

for small requests (negligible transmission delay)  
estimation of propagation (speed of the medium)

- queuing
- processing delay

### TCP connection - handshake

(TCP connection initiated by client)

1. h1
2. h2
3. h3 + HTTP request
4. HTTP response (+ transmission delay)

(connection closed by server)

2RTT + transmission delay (L/R)

Non-persistent TCP connection  
need to restart connection for each object


## Jan 27
Quiz Wednesday - everything on chapter 1,  HTTP, persistent & non-persistent

## HTTP/1.0
- ASCII format
- non-persistent, need to restart the connection for ever request sent
- cannot make a request if there's a pending request

### Improved HTTP/1.0
- can establish parallel connections because each connection is identified by `IP Address + port number`
- HTTP/1.0 with 10 parallel connections

### HTTP/1.1
- ASCII format
- persistent
- pipelined
- have to be served in order

#### number of RTTS
- 1 RTT - TCP connection establishment
- 31 objects -> 31 RTTS + 1 RTT for TCP establishment

#### HTTP pipelining
- requests are sent on a single TCP connection without waiting for responses

### HTTP/2.0
- Binary format (Huffman Codes)
- persistent
- streams
- server can respond in any order
- parallel connections
- push promise, priority processing

#### HTTP/2.0 Frame

|Frame (encoded in binary):  
---------
|HEADER - HTTP Request  
|DATA - HTTP request header

|Frame Type:
---------
|HEADER - header / data

#### TCP Connection
- Stream 1
  - Frame 1 (type)
  - Frame 2 (type)
- Stream 2
- ...

## HTTP Message Format
The first line of an HTTP request message is called the request line;   
the subsequent lines are called the header lines.  
The request line has three fields: the method field, the URL field, and the HTTP version field.  
The method field can take on several different values, including GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, and DELETE.

## Jan 29

HTTP - stateless, does not remember you

### Cookies
1. client - http request
1. server generates an id, ie. `id=kajsd;lvkaj`
1. http response, SET cookie
1. http request with cookie


#### Cookies
|cookie
---
|id & servername
|...


### Cache
1. client - http request
1. server - http response + last modified date
1. client (stores in cache)

next time requesting the same object
1. client - http request, if modified since date
1. server - http response, not modified

#### proxy server
local web cache - acts as both server and client

1. client - http request to proxy server
1. proxy server - http request to server, get if
1. (if object has changed since date) server - http response new object
1. proxy server - saves the new objects
1. proxy server - http response to client

### MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
####  SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- PUSH based protocol
- requires all message content to be in ASCII
- puts everything in one message and encode in ASCII (everything is encoded in ASCII)

#### HTTP
- mostly PULL
- gives freedom to add anything in the body (hdr ascii, body binayr, image, video, audio...)
- has to send out request for every object on the page

#### Pull / Push based model
client initiates the connection  server always on
- PULL: pulled by client <--- (information data)
- PUSH: (information data) ---> pushed by client

### Mail Access Protocol
- PULL based mechanism

### Email
**user agent** -(PUSH)-> [mailbox for each user] **machine1** (always on, client[sending] and server[receiving]) --(TCP, PUSH)--> **machine2** (always on) -(PULL)-> **recipient**   
- user -> machine1 -> machine2 : SMTP (PUSH)
- machine2 -> recipient : Mail Access Protocol (PULL)(pop3, http, imap, ...)
- TCP for reliability

- uses port # 25
- always server listening on the port number

1. ~user agent clone => synchronize communication~
  - ~uses UDP because TCP requires handshake (the recipient always available)~
1. ~agent 1. user agent "reader" 2. mail server~
1. push message - mail transfer agent to be an always on server


### Network Models
#### Client server model
- Always ON server
- Client initiates
- server has INFO

#### P2P
- (to be added)

### using uwaterloo smtp server
```
telnet mxer.uwaterloo.ca 25
HELO crepes.fr
MAIL FROM: bob@crepes.fr
RCPT TO: kzh@uwaterloo.ca
DATA
<message body>
. // end of email message

(new message, repeat mail from -> data step)

QUIT
```

use Extended SMTP
```
EHLO crepes.fr
```
An ESMTP server returns the code 250 OK in a multi-line reply with its domain and a list of keywords to indicate supported extension


### traceroute

## Feb 5

### POP (Post Office Protocol)
port # 110  
(stateless, does not remember what you were doing)
- usr
- pass
- list [message id, size of message bytes]
- retr

### IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol)
port # 143  
- uid (session id) `a01  login  usr  pswd`
- `LIST` list mailboxes (folder)
- `SELECT`
- `FETCH`
- `MOVE`

easy for mailing lists

#### cmd of IMAP
noop


### DNS (Domain Name Server)
- directory service for translating hostnames to IP addr

servername -> IP address

#### hosts.txt
132.25.36.48  (IPV4)
each dot separates 1 byte (8bits)  
range: 0-255

#### problems
- consistency / maintenance
- single print of failure
- storage
- high delay for some locations
- high

#### Hierarchical Distributed Direction Service
- root: DNS servers
- Top Level Domain (TLD) DNS Servers
  - .com (TLD)
    - google (authoritative)
    - facebook (authoritative)
  - .net (TLD)
  - .gov (TLD)
Every organization that makes their public,
authoritative DNS server

#### www.google.com
1. query root servers
1. response (IP address) TLD:.com servers
1. query TLD com server, respond (IP Address) Authoritative google DNS server IP address
1. query google Auth for www.google.com, respond <something>

#### what needs to be defined in application layer protocol?
- command / data format
- port number

## Feb 10

### DNS
- port #53
- query & response

#### MSG Format
| message format
---
| 16 bit UID (to authenticate)
|FLAGS [1 bit response or query] [1 bit if coming from authoritative dns server][1 bit recursion available] [1 bit recursion desirable]
| NUM OF QUERYS
|NUM OF ANSWERS
|QUERYS
|ANSWERS
|OPTIONAL


#### Resource record
| |
|-|
NAME: DOMAIN NAME[foo.com], CNAME[real name of the physical machine], hostname
VALUE: IP address
TYPE: A (type a means needs ip address)

| |
|-|
NAME: Domain name
VALUE: Authoritative DNS
TYPE: NS

| |
|-|
NAME: Domain name
VALUE: mail server
TYPE: MX

| |
|-|
NAME: HOST
VALUE: Canonical name
TYPE: CNAME

TYPE: MX, A, CNAME, NS

### DNS request
iterative:
```
user -> Local DNS [cached]---[www.example.com]---> root
                          <--[TLD com server]-----
                          ---------------[www.example.com]--------------> TLD com server
                          <--[authoritative DNS server of example.com]---
                          <------- HTTP -----------example.com
```

recursive:
```
USER -> LDNS <==> ROOT <==> TLD  <==> AUTHORITATIVE
```

root server only keeps A and NS records for tld servers

com TLD servers keep authoritative & unauthoritative records

### CDN - Content delivery networks
- streaming
- playback

variable:
- bit rates
- buffer: to store bits
- buffer > threshold => streaming

#### total time to transfer file to all N users
max{NF/u_s, F/d_min}
- d_i: download speed for user i
- N: number of users
- u_s: upload speed
- F: file size
- d_min = min_{1<i<N} {d_i} (lowest download speed among all of the downloaders)

### CDN
- content placement
  - pull
  - push
- server placement
  - deep @ ISP access (server close to the user [local ISP providers])
  - home @ IXP (reduce the traffic from A to B)

### -
1. resolve netflix.com
  1. query root
  1. root responses with com TLD
  1. query com TLD
  1. com TLD responds with authoritative server type NS, type A
  1. IP resolved

### P2p
- bittorrent
- server not always on
- client <-----> client



## Feb 24 - Review

### How to request chunks

HTTP Server -
Response:
```
200 OK HTTP/1.1
Accept Range Bytes
```
HTTP Client Request
```
Range 999-2899
```
the range of bytes thats requested  
HTTP gives the ability to request the range of chunks


### Client-server model & p2p
which is more effective in distributing files (availability)
- client, always on

in terms of distributing file
- p2p, decrease the time if everyone participates

p2p can download file without sharing anything
- because there are seeders that only shares the file

at most how many peers can connect to
- 4(textbook) or 5

can build a reliable service on unreliable application layer
- reliable: packet delivery, detect & fix corruption
- if throughput, delay is not implemented in lower layer, then cannot build upper layer

packet switched network
- no delay, throughput guarentees in packet switched network
- can drop a packet

When will there be packet loss
- a queue at router R_S > R_D
- S --[R_S]-- X --[R_D]-- D

Can build a service without packet loss


### sending a message from p1 to p2
| App P1 | MSG |
|-|-|

Transport (get processes to talk to each other)  
- there are multiple processes, we need the port number to  send to know which processes to send to  
- responsible for sending data to correct processes  
- TCP: 4 tuple - dest IP, dest port #, source IP, source port #
- UDP: 2 tuple - source IP, source port #
- TCP (4 tuple) / UDP (2 tuple) can use the same port, since transport layer can distinguish between the two based on different identifiers
- multiplex / demultiplex messages (attach IP & port # [TCP 4 tuple, UDP 2 tuple] to message, distinguish, deliver to the right processes)

|H_T|MSG|
|-|-|

Network   (get two end systems to talk to each other, from source to destination)

|H_N|H_T|MSG|
|-|-|-|


Link Layer (get to the next point in the path i.e. switch, router)

|H_L|H_N|H_T|MSG|
|-|-|-|-|

Physical Layer


Why do we only go up to network layer in router
- (?) only needs to know where to go


### detect corrouption of data
- checksum
