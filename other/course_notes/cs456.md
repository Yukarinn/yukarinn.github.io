### Application Protocol
- message format & type
  - HTTP request
  - HTTP response
- event handling
- PORT #

### HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

-> Port # = 80

Assume Client/Server model

Server name ---DNS---> IP address  
HTTP server listens on port 80

Cliemt initiate connection
  - application create a socket to transport layer and uses TCP for reliability
  - delivers in-order packets

Server's port number has to be 80 becuase it should be well known
  - implies client can use any port number


### HTTP Request
```
GET (URL that is requesting) (URL - uniform resource locater)
header line - xyz.come/index.html (object URL)
Host: www.xyz.com
(can have many header lines)
------
Entity body: DATA
```

### HTTP response
```
HTTP/ 200(status code)  - (status line)
Date of retrival
Content length: number of bytes in the entity
Content type: HTML/Text etc.
------
Entity body: DATA
```

#### HTTP Status codes:
- 1xx 2xx - successful
- 3xx redirection
- 4xx client error - error in the request
- 5xx server error

### Client
- initiates TCP connection on port number 80  
  (TCP: 3-way handshake)

### RTT - round trip time
estimation of propogation
- queuing
- processing delay

### TCP connection - handshake
(connection initiated by client)  
1. h1
2. h2
3. h3 + HTTP request
4. HTTP response  

(connection closed by server)

2RTT + transmission delay

Non-spersistant TCP connection  
need to restart connection for each object
