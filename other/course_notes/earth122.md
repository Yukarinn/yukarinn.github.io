## Evolution

**Biological evolution**: genetic change in populations of organisms across generation

**Natural Selection**: the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction are passed on more frequently to future generations than those that do not

## Genetic variation

**Adaptive Trait (Adaptation)**: a trait that promotes reproductive success•A trait that reduces success is said to be maladaptive

**Mutations**: accidental changes in DNA that may be passed on to the next generation

## Natural selection acts on genetic variation

- **Directional selection**: drives a feature in one direction
- **Stabilizing selection**: produces intermediate traits, preserving the status quo
- **Disruptive selection**: traits diverge in two or more directions

## Evolution

Selective pressures from the environment influence adaptation. Environmental conditions determine what natural selection will exert.

**Divergent evolution**: Closely related species that live in different environments and thus experience different selective pressures tend to diverge in their trait

**Convergent evolution**: Unrelated species may have similar traits as a result of adapting to selective pressures from similar environment

## Biodiversity

Evolution generates biodiversity

**Biological Diversity**: total variety of all organisms in the area taking into account of: –The diversity of species –Their genes –Their populations–Their habitats –Their communities
**Species**: a population or group of populations whose members share characteristics and can freely breed with one another and produce fertile offspring
**Population**: a group of individuals of a species that live in the same are

## Speciation produces new types of organisms

- **Allopatric speciation**: species formation due to physical separation of populations
- **Sympatric speciation**: species form from populations that become reproductively isolated within the same area

## Diversification

**Phylogenetic trees(Cladograms)**

- Scientists can trace when certain traits evolved
- Show relationships between specie

## Extinction

**Extinction**: the disappearance of a species from Earth

- **Background extinction rate**: extinction usually occurs one species at a time
- **Mass extinction events**: five events in Earth’s history that killed off massive numbers of species at once

**Endemic species**: a species only exists in a certain, specialized area. These species:

- Are very susceptible to extinction
- Usually have small population

## Ecology

We study ecology at several levels

- **Biosphere**: the total living things on Earth and the areas they inhabit
- **Ecosystem**: communities and the nonliving material and forces they interact with
- **Community**: interacting species that live in the same area

**Population ecology**: investigates the quantitative dynamics of how individuals within a species interact\
**Community ecology**: focuses on interactions among species\
**Ecosystem ecology**: studies living and nonliving components of systems to reveal pattern

## Habitat

**Habitat**: the environment in which an organism lives –Includes living and nonliving elements–Scale-dependent: from square centimeters to kilometers

- **Habitat use**: each organism thrives in certain habitats, but not in others
- **Habitat selection**: the process by which organisms actively select habitats in which to live–Availability and quality of habitat are crucial to an organism’s well-being–Human developments conflict with this process

## Niche

**Niche**: an organism’s use of resources and its functional role in a community–Habitat use, food selection, role in energy and nutrient flow–Interactions with other individuals

- **Specialists**: species with narrow niches and very specific requirements–Extremely good at what they do, but vulnerable to change
- **Generalists**: species with broad niches that can use a wide array of habitats and resources–Able to live in many different place

## Population

**Population**: individual of the same species inhabiting a particular area

- **Population size**: the number of individual organisms present at a given time
- **Population density**: the number of individuals within a population per unit area
- **Population distribution (dispersion)**: spatial arrangement of organisms within an area
  - Random - haphazardly located individuals, with no pattern; resources distributed uniformly
  - Uniform - individuals are evenly spaced due to territoriality;
  - Clumped - arranged according to availability of resources.
    - Most common in nature
    - Due to behavior (sardines), concentrated resources, some habitat may be better than others

**Sex ratio**: proportion of males to female\
**Age Structure**: the relative numbers of organisms of each age within a population

- Age structure diagrams (pyramids) = show the age structure of population

**Crude birth/death rates**: number of births or deaths per 1000 individuals for a given time period\
**Survivorship curves**: to show likelihood of death varies with age

- Type I: More deaths at older ages
- Type II: Equal number of deaths at all ages
- Type III: More deaths at young ages

## Population Growth

Population growth, stability or decline is determined by 4 factors:

- **Natality**: births within the population
- **Mortality**: deaths within the population
- **Immigration**: arrival of individuals from outside the population
- **Emigration**: departure of individuals from the population

**Growth rate formula**: = (Crude birth rate + immigration rate) - (Crude death rate + emigration rate) = Growth rate

## Limiting factors restrain growth

**Limiting factors**: physical, chemical and biological characteristics that restrain population growth

- water, space, food, predators, and disease
  **Environmental resistance**: All limiting factors taken together\
  **Carrying capacity**: the maximum population size of a species that its environment can sustain\
  **Logistic growth curve**: S-shaped curve used to model population growth

## Reproductive strategies

(on exam 1)

**Biotic potential**: the ability (maximum capacity) of an organism to produce offspring (under ideal environmental conditions). (Fish vs whales)

- **k-selected species**: animals with long gestation periods and few offspring
  - Have a low biotic potential
  - Stabilize at or near carrying capacity
  - Good competitors
- **r-selected species**: animals which reproduce quickly
  - Have a high biotic potential–Little parental care

## Competition

**Competition**: relationship where multiple organisms seek the same limited resources: food, water, space, shelter, mates, sunlight

- **Intraspecific competition**: among members of the same species
  - High population density = increased competition
- **Interspecific competition**: among members of two or more species
  - Can lead to either competitive exclusion or to species coexistence

**Resource partitioning**: species divide shared resources by specializing in different ways, and can lead to  
**Character displacement**: competing species evolve physical characteristics that reflect their reliance on the portion of the resource they use

## Competitive Interactions

- **Predation**: process by which individuals of one species (predators) capture, kill, and consume individuals of another species (prey)
- **Parasitism**: a relationship in which one organism (parasite) depends on another (host) for nourishment or other benefit
- **Herbivory**: exploitation in which animals feed on the tissues of plants


## Mutualists

Two or more species benefit from their interactions
- **Symbiosis**: mutualism in which the organisms live in close physical contact
- **Pollination**: bees, bats, birds and others transfer pollen from one flower to another, fertilizing its eggs, resulting in frui

## Interaction have no effect on some participants
**Amensalism**: a relationship in which one organism is harmed while the other is unaffected
  - **Allelopathy**: certain plants release harmful chemical

**Commensalism**: a relationship in which one organism benefits, while the other remains unaffected
  - **Facilitation**: plants that create shade and leaf litter allow seedlings to gro

## Ecological communities
**Community**: an assemblage of species living in the same place at the same time  
**Community ecologists**: people interested in how:
- Species coexist and  relate to one another
- Communities change, and why patterns exist

## Trophic levels
Rank in the feeding hierarchy
- Producers
- Consumers
- Detritivores and Decomposer

### Producers
the first trophic level
  - **Autotrophs** (“self-feeders”) = organisms that capture solar energy for photosynthesis to produce sugar
  - **Chemosynthetic bacteria** use the geothermal energy in hot springs or deep-sea vents to produce their food
  - **Stromatolites**: accretionary structures formed in shallow water by cementation of cyanobacteria and other microorganisms

### Consumers
organisms that consume producers
- **Primary consumers**: second trophic level
  - Organisms that consume producers
  - **Herbivores** consume plants (e.g.Deer, grasshoppers)
- **Secondary consumers**: third trophic level
  - Organisms that prey on primary consumers
  - **Carnivores** consume meat (e.g., wolves, tigers)
- **Tertiary Consumers**: fourth trophic level
  - Predators at the highest trophic level
  - Consume secondary consumers
  - Are also carnivores (e.g. Hawks, owls)
  - **Omnivores** consumers that eat both plants and animal

### Detritivores and decomposers
Organisms that consume nonliving organic matter  
Enrich soils and/or recycle nutrients found in dead organisms

- **Detritivores**: scavenge waste products or dead bodies
  - Millipedes, earthworms
- **Decomposers**: break down leaf litter and other non-living material
  - Fungi, bacteria
  - Enhance topsoil and recycle nutrients


## Food chain
**Food chain**: the relationship of how energy is transferred up the trophic levels  
**Food web**: a visual map of feeding relationships and energy flow

## Keystone species
a species that has a particularly strong or far-reaching impact in ecological communities.

## Communities respond to disturbance in different ways
Communities experience many types of disturbance
- Removal of  keystone species, spread of invasive species, natural disturbances (hurricanes, tornadoes, fire, etc)
- Human impacts can cause major changes

**Resistance**: community of organisms resists change and remains stable despite the disturbance  
**Resilience**: a community changes in response to a disturbance, but later returns to its original state


## Succession
the predictable series of changes in a community following a disturbance

- **Primary succession**: disturbance eliminates all vegetation and/or soil life
   - Glaciers, drying lakes, volcanic lava
   - **Pioneer species**: the first species to arrive in a primary succession area

- **Secondary succession**: a disturbance dramatically alters, but does not destroy, all local organisms
  - The remaining organisms form “building blocks” for the next population species
  - Fires, hurricanes, farming, logging

**Climax community**: the community resulting from successful succession
  - Remains stable until another disturbance restarts succession

## Invasive species
non-native (exotic) organisms that spread widely and become dominant in a community
  - Growth-limiting factors (predators, disease, etc.) are removed or absent

### Techniques to control invasive species  
- Remove manually
- Toxic chemicals–Drying them out
- Depriving of oxygen
- Stressing them
  - Heat, sound, electricity, carbon dioxide, ultraviolet light

**Prevention, rather than control, is the best policy.**


## Ecological restoration
returning an area to earlier conditions
- Informed by **restoration ecology**: the science of restoring an area to the condition that existed before humans changed it
- It is difficult, time-consuming, expensive
- Best to protect natural systems from degradation in the first place

## Biome

1. Boreal forest (taiga)
1. Temperate deciduous forest
1. Temperate grassland
1. Temperate rainforest
