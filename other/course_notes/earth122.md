## Evolution

**Biological evolution**: genetic change in populations of organisms across generation

**Natural Selection**: the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction are passed on more frequently to future generations than those that do not

## Genetic variation

**Adaptive Trait (Adaptation)**: a trait that promotes reproductive success**A trait that reduces success is said to be maladaptive

**Mutations**: accidental changes in DNA that may be passed on to the next generation

## Natural selection acts on genetic variation

- **Directional selection**: drives a feature in one direction
- **Stabilizing selection**: produces intermediate traits, preserving the status quo
- **Disruptive selection**: traits diverge in two or more directions

## Evolution

Selective pressures from the environment influence adaptation. Environmental conditions determine what natural selection will exert.

**Divergent evolution**: Closely related species that live in different environments and thus experience different selective pressures tend to diverge in their trait

**Convergent evolution**: Unrelated species may have similar traits as a result of adapting to selective pressures from similar environment

## Biodiversity

Evolution generates biodiversity

**Biological Diversity**: total variety of all organisms in the area taking into account of: –The diversity of species –Their genes –Their populations–Their habitats –Their communities
**Species**: a population or group of populations whose members share characteristics and can freely breed with one another and produce fertile offspring
**Population**: a group of individuals of a species that live in the same are

## Speciation produces new types of organisms

- **Allopatric speciation**: species formation due to physical separation of populations
- **Sympatric speciation**: species form from populations that become reproductively isolated within the same area

## Diversification

**Phylogenetic trees(Cladograms)**

- Scientists can trace when certain traits evolved
- Show relationships between specie

## Extinction

**Extinction**: the disappearance of a species from Earth

- **Background extinction rate**: extinction usually occurs one species at a time
- **Mass extinction events**: five events in Earth’s history that killed off massive numbers of species at once

**Endemic species**: a species only exists in a certain, specialized area. These species:

- Are very susceptible to extinction
- Usually have small population

## Ecology

We study ecology at several levels

- **Biosphere**: the total living things on Earth and the areas they inhabit
- **Ecosystem**: communities and the nonliving material and forces they interact with
- **Community**: interacting species that live in the same area

**Population ecology**: investigates the quantitative dynamics of how individuals within a species interact\
**Community ecology**: focuses on interactions among species\
**Ecosystem ecology**: studies living and nonliving components of systems to reveal pattern

## Habitat

**Habitat**: the environment in which an organism lives –Includes living and nonliving elements–Scale-dependent: from square centimeters to kilometers

- **Habitat use**: each organism thrives in certain habitats, but not in others
- **Habitat selection**: the process by which organisms actively select habitats in which to live–Availability and quality of habitat are crucial to an organism’s well-being–Human developments conflict with this process

## Niche

**Niche**: an organism’s use of resources and its functional role in a community–Habitat use, food selection, role in energy and nutrient flow–Interactions with other individuals

- **Specialists**: species with narrow niches and very specific requirements–Extremely good at what they do, but vulnerable to change
- **Generalists**: species with broad niches that can use a wide array of habitats and resources–Able to live in many different place

## Population

**Population**: individual of the same species inhabiting a particular area

- **Population size**: the number of individual organisms present at a given time
- **Population density**: the number of individuals within a population per unit area
- **Population distribution (dispersion)**: spatial arrangement of organisms within an area
  - Random - haphazardly located individuals, with no pattern; resources distributed uniformly
  - Uniform - individuals are evenly spaced due to territoriality;
  - Clumped - arranged according to availability of resources.
    - Most common in nature
    - Due to behavior (sardines), concentrated resources, some habitat may be better than others

**Sex ratio**: proportion of males to female\
**Age Structure**: the relative numbers of organisms of each age within a population

- Age structure diagrams (pyramids) = show the age structure of population

**Crude birth/death rates**: number of births or deaths per 1000 individuals for a given time period\
**Survivorship curves**: to show likelihood of death varies with age

- Type I: More deaths at older ages
- Type II: Equal number of deaths at all ages
- Type III: More deaths at young ages

## Population Growth

Population growth, stability or decline is determined by 4 factors:

- **Natality**: births within the population
- **Mortality**: deaths within the population
- **Immigration**: arrival of individuals from outside the population
- **Emigration**: departure of individuals from the population

**Growth rate formula**: = (Crude birth rate + immigration rate) - (Crude death rate + emigration rate) = Growth rate

## Limiting factors restrain growth

**Limiting factors**: physical, chemical and biological characteristics that restrain population growth

- water, space, food, predators, and disease
  **Environmental resistance**: All limiting factors taken together\
  **Carrying capacity**: the maximum population size of a species that its environment can sustain\
  **Logistic growth curve**: S-shaped curve used to model population growth

## Reproductive strategies

(on exam 1)

**Biotic potential**: the ability (maximum capacity) of an organism to produce offspring (under ideal environmental conditions). (Fish vs whales)

- **k-selected species**: animals with long gestation periods and few offspring
  - Have a low biotic potential
  - Stabilize at or near carrying capacity
  - Good competitors
- **r-selected species**: animals which reproduce quickly
  - Have a high biotic potential–Little parental care




# Jan 23

## Competition

**Competition**: relationship where multiple organisms seek the same limited resources: food, water, space, shelter, mates, sunlight

- **Intraspecific competition**: among members of the same species
  - High population density = increased competition
- **Interspecific competition**: among members of two or more species
  - Can lead to either competitive exclusion or to species coexistence

**Resource partitioning**: species divide shared resources by specializing in different ways, and can lead to  
**Character displacement**: competing species evolve physical characteristics that reflect their reliance on the portion of the resource they use

## Competitive Interactions

- **Predation**: process by which individuals of one species (predators) capture, kill, and consume individuals of another species (prey)
- **Parasitism**: a relationship in which one organism (parasite) depends on another (host) for nourishment or other benefit
- **Herbivory**: exploitation in which animals feed on the tissues of plants


## Mutualists

Two or more species benefit from their interactions
- **Symbiosis**: mutualism in which the organisms live in close physical contact
- **Pollination**: bees, bats, birds and others transfer pollen from one flower to another, fertilizing its eggs, resulting in frui

## Interaction have no effect on some participants
**Amensalism**: a relationship in which one organism is harmed while the other is unaffected
  - **Allelopathy**: certain plants release harmful chemical

**Commensalism**: a relationship in which one organism benefits, while the other remains unaffected
  - **Facilitation**: plants that create shade and leaf litter allow seedlings to gro

## Ecological communities
**Community**: an assemblage of species living in the same place at the same time  
**Community ecologists**: people interested in how:
- Species coexist and  relate to one another
- Communities change, and why patterns exist

## Trophic levels
Rank in the feeding hierarchy
- Producers
- Consumers
- Detritivores and Decomposer

### Producers
the first trophic level
  - **Autotrophs** (“self-feeders”) = organisms that capture solar energy for photosynthesis to produce sugar
  - **Chemosynthetic bacteria** use the geothermal energy in hot springs or deep-sea vents to produce their food
  - **Stromatolites**: accretionary structures formed in shallow water by cementation of cyanobacteria and other microorganisms

### Consumers
organisms that consume producers
- **Primary consumers**: second trophic level
  - Organisms that consume producers
  - **Herbivores** consume plants (e.g.Deer, grasshoppers)
- **Secondary consumers**: third trophic level
  - Organisms that prey on primary consumers
  - **Carnivores** consume meat (e.g., wolves, tigers)
- **Tertiary Consumers**: fourth trophic level
  - Predators at the highest trophic level
  - Consume secondary consumers
  - Are also carnivores (e.g. Hawks, owls)
  - **Omnivores** consumers that eat both plants and animal

### Detritivores and decomposers
Organisms that consume nonliving organic matter  
Enrich soils and/or recycle nutrients found in dead organisms

- **Detritivores**: scavenge waste products or dead bodies
  - Millipedes, earthworms
- **Decomposers**: break down leaf litter and other non-living material
  - Fungi, bacteria
  - Enhance topsoil and recycle nutrients


## Food chain
**Food chain**: the relationship of how energy is transferred up the trophic levels  
**Food web**: a visual map of feeding relationships and energy flow

## Keystone species
a species that has a particularly strong or far-reaching impact in ecological communities.

## Communities respond to disturbance in different ways
Communities experience many types of disturbance
- Removal of  keystone species, spread of invasive species, natural disturbances (hurricanes, tornadoes, fire, etc)
- Human impacts can cause major changes

**Resistance**: community of organisms resists change and remains stable despite the disturbance  
**Resilience**: a community changes in response to a disturbance, but later returns to its original state


## Succession
the predictable series of changes in a community following a disturbance

- **Primary succession**: disturbance eliminates all vegetation and/or soil life
   - Glaciers, drying lakes, volcanic lava
   - **Pioneer species**: the first species to arrive in a primary succession area

- **Secondary succession**: a disturbance dramatically alters, but does not destroy, all local organisms
  - The remaining organisms form “building blocks” for the next population species
  - Fires, hurricanes, farming, logging

**Climax community**: the community resulting from successful succession
  - Remains stable until another disturbance restarts succession

## Invasive species
non-native (exotic) organisms that spread widely and become dominant in a community
  - Growth-limiting factors (predators, disease, etc.) are removed or absent

### Techniques to control invasive species  
- Remove manually
- Toxic chemicals–Drying them out
- Depriving of oxygen
- Stressing them
  - Heat, sound, electricity, carbon dioxide, ultraviolet light

**Prevention, rather than control, is the best policy.**


## Ecological restoration
returning an area to earlier conditions
- Informed by **restoration ecology**: the science of restoring an area to the condition that existed before humans changed it
- It is difficult, time-consuming, expensive
- Best to protect natural systems from degradation in the first place

## Biome
major regional complex of similar communities, recognized by: plant type, vegetation structure.

1. Tundra
1. Boreal forest (taiga)
1. Temperate deciduous forest
1. Temperate grassland
1. Temperate rainforest
1. Tropical rainforest
1. Tropical dry forest
1. Savannah
1. Desert
1. Mediterranean (chaparral)


**Climatographs**: shows an area’s mean monthly temperature and precipitation
- Similar biomes occupy similar latitudes

# Chapter 7 Soils - Jan 30

Soil consists of mineral matter, organic matter, air, and water
- Dead and living microorganisms, and decaying material
- Bacteria, algae, earthworms, insects, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles

## Soil is a complex, dynamic mixture
**Parent material**: the base geologic material of soil–Determines the starting composition of the soil  
**Organic matter** includes living and dead microorganisms as well as decaying plant and animal material  
**Water** is not pure, contains dissolved minerals and organics and is important for support of plant growth  
**Air** soil air is not the same as air we breath

## Soil formation
**bedrock**:  the continuous mass of solid rock comprising the Earth’s crust

**Weathering** = the physical, chemical, or biological processes that break down rocks to form soil
- **Physical (mechanical)** = wind and rain, no chemical changes in the parent material
- **Chemical** = substances chemically interact with parent material
- **Biological** = organisms break down parent material
 - deposition, decomposition, and accumulation of organic matter
 - **Humus** = a dark, spongy, crumbly mass of material formed by partial decomposition
- **Erosion** = the dislodging and movement of soil by wind or water
  - Occurs when vegetation is absent
  - When deposited elsewhere referred to as sediment

## Soil Profile
- **Horizon** = each layer of soil
- **Soil profile** = the cross-section of soil as a whole
- **Topsoil** = inorganic and organic material most nutritive for plants
- **Leaching** = dissolved particles move down through horizons
- **Litter** = surface deposits of leaves, branches, mosses, animal waste


## Horizons
- **O Horizon** = organic matter/peat deposits
- **A Horizon** = topsoil
- **B Horizon**  = subsoil, hardpan
- **C Horizon** = broken parent material
- **R Horizon** = unaltered parent material
- **W Horizon** = distinct layer of water in some soils
- **Permafrost** = some arctic soils contain a perennially frozen layer

## Soil categories
Soils classified into various categories using properties such as: Colour, Texture, Structure, pH

- **Soil colour** = indicates its composition and fertility
  - Black or dark brown = rich in organic matter
  - Pale gray or white = indicates leaching
- **Soil texture** = the size of particle
  - Clay (smallest), silt, sand (largest)
  - **porosity** = measure of the relative volume of spaces within the material;
  - **permeability** = measure of interconnectedness of the spaces and the ease with which fluids can move through the material
- **Loam** = soil with an even mixture of the three
  - Clay (smallest), silt, sand (largest)
- **Soil structure** = a measure of soil’s “clumpiness”   
  - Large clumps can discourage plant roots–Repeated tilling compacts soil
  - **Plowpan** = a hard layer resulting from repeated plowing that resists water infiltration and root penetration
- **Soil pH** = influences a soil’s ability to support plant growth
  - Soils that are too acidic (low pH) or basic (high pH) can kill plants

## Ion exchange
**Cation exchange** = process that allows plants to gain nutrients
- Negatively charged soils hold cations of calcium, magnesium, and potassium

**Cation exchange capacity** = a soil’s ability to hold cations, preventing them from leaching, thereby increasing their availability to plant

## Nitrogen Cycle
- **Nitrogen fixation** = inert nitrogen gas (N2) from the atmosphere is combined with hydrogen to form ions of ammonium (NH4+)
- **Nitrification** = specialized bacteria converts ammonium ions into nitrite ions (NO2-), then by  another group of specialized bacteria into nitrate ions (NO3-)
- **Denitrification** =  bacteria convert nitrates in soil or water into gaseous forms of nitrogen
  - Carried out by several varieties of bacteria

## Soil Erosion
Soil erosion is part of the constant recycling of Earth materials and is part of the rock cycle.  Once soil forms, Erosional Forces: Water, Wind, Ice, and Gravity move soil from one place to another

**Deposition** = the arrival of eroded material at its new location


## Desertification
- A loss of more than 10% productivity from erosion, soil compaction, forest removal, overgrazing, salinization, climate change, depletion of water sources
- A type of land degradation
- Affects 1/3 of the planet’s land area
- Most prone areas are arid and semiarid lan

## Erosion control practices
- **Crop rotation**:
  alternating the crops grown field from one season or year to the ne
- **Contour farming**: plowing furrows sideways across a hillside, perpendicular to its slope, to prevent rills and gullies
- **Intercropping and agroforestry**: planting different types of crops in alternating bands or other spatially mixed arrangements to increase ground cover
- **Terracing**: level platforms are cut into steep hillsides, forming a “staircase” to contain water
- **Shelterbelts**: rows of tall, perennial plants are planted along the edges of fields to slow the wind
  - **Alley cropping** = shelterbelts + intercroppin
- **Reduced tillage**: furrows are cut in the soil, a seed is dropped in and the furrow is closed


## Irrigation can cause long-term soil problems
- **Irrigation** = Artificially providing water to support agriculture
- **Waterlogging** = over-irrigated soils which suffocates roots
- **Salinization** = the buildup of salts in surface soil layer

## Other chemicals also contribute to soil contamination
- **Fertilizer** = substances that contain essential nutrients but over-application can damage soils
- **Inorganic fertilizers** = mined or synthetically manufactured mineral supplements
- **Organic fertilizers** = the remains or wastes of organisms
  - manure, crop residues, fresh vegetation
  - **Compost** = produced when decomposers break down organic matter
  - Not perfect

## Biochar
biomass is reduced to a black, carbon-rich, charcoal-like residue
- Can hold onto plant nutrients thus enhancing fertility of soil
- Also effective at absorbing and holding heavy metals
- May act as a long-term reservoir for carbon
