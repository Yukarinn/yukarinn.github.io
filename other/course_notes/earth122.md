## Evolution
**Biological evolution**: genetic change in populations of organisms across generation

**Natural Selection**: the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction are passed on more frequently to future generations than those that do not

## Genetic variation
**Adaptive Trait (Adaptation)**: a trait that promotes reproductive success•A trait that reduces success is said to be maladaptive

**Mutations**: accidental changes in DNA that may be passed on to the next generation

## Natural selection acts on genetic variation

- **Directional selection**: drives a feature in one direction
- **Stabilizing selection**: produces intermediate traits, preserving the status quo
- **Disruptive selection**: traits diverge in two or more directions

## Evolution
Selective pressures from the environment influence adaptation. Environmental conditions determine what natural selection will exert.

**Divergent evolution**: Closely related species that live in different environments and thus experience different selective pressures tend to diverge in their trait

**Convergent evolution**: Unrelated species may have similar traits as a result of adapting to selective pressures from similar environment

## Biodiversity
Evolution generates biodiversity

**Biological Diversity**: total variety of all organisms in the area taking into account of: –The diversity of species –Their genes  –Their populations–Their habitats –Their communities
**Species**: a population or group of populations whose members share characteristics and can freely breed with one another and produce fertile offspring
**Population**: a group of individuals of a species that live in the same are

## Speciation produces new types of organisms
- **Allopatric speciation**: species formation due to physical separation of populations
- **Sympatric speciation**: species form from populations that become reproductively isolated within the same area

## Diversification

**Phylogenetic trees(Cladograms)**
- Scientists can trace when certain traits evolved
- Show relationships between specie

## Extinction

**Extinction**: the disappearance of a species from Earth

- **Background extinction rate**: extinction usually occurs one species at a time
- **Mass extinction events**: five events in Earth’s history that killed off massive numbers of species at once

**Endemic species**: a species only exists in a certain, specialized area. These species:
- Are very susceptible to extinction
- Usually have small population


## Ecology

We study ecology at several levels

- **Biosphere**: the total living things on Earth and the areas they inhabit
- **Ecosystem**: communities and the nonliving material and forces they interact with
- **Community**: interacting species that live in the same area

**Population ecology**: investigates the quantitative dynamics of how individuals within a species interact\
**Community ecology**: focuses on interactions among species\
**Ecosystem ecology**: studies living and nonliving components of systems to reveal pattern

## Habitat

**Habitat**: the environment in which an organism lives –Includes living and nonliving elements–Scale-dependent: from square centimeters to kilometers
- **Habitat use**: each organism thrives in certain habitats, but not in others
- **Habitat selection**: the process by which organisms actively select habitats in which to live–Availability and quality of habitat are crucial to an organism’s well-being–Human developments conflict with this process


## Niche
**Niche**: an organism’s use of resources and its functional role in a community–Habitat use, food selection, role in energy and nutrient flow–Interactions with other individuals

-  **Specialists**: species with narrow niches and very specific requirements–Extremely good at what they do, but vulnerable to change
- **Generalists**: species with broad niches that can use a wide array of habitats and resources–Able to live in many different place


## Population

**Population**: individual of the same species inhabiting a particular area

- **Population size**: the number of individual organisms present at a given time
- **Population density**: the number of individuals within a population per unit area
- **Population distribution (dispersion)**: spatial arrangement of organisms within an area
  - Random - haphazardly located individuals, with no pattern; resources distributed uniformly
  - Uniform - individuals are evenly spaced due to territoriality;
  - Clumped - arranged according to availability of resources.
    - Most common in nature
    - Due to behavior (sardines), concentrated resources, some habitat may be better than others

**Sex ratio**: proportion of males to female\
**Age Structure**: the relative numbers of organisms of each age within a population
- Age structure diagrams (pyramids) = show the age structure of population


**Crude birth/death rates**: number of births or deaths per 1000 individuals for a given time period\
**Survivorship curves**: to show likelihood of death varies with age
- Type I: More deaths at older ages
- Type II: Equal number of deaths at all ages
- Type III: More deaths at young ages

## Population Growth

Population growth, stability or decline is determined by 4 factors:
- **Natality**: births within the population
- **Mortality**: deaths within the population
- **Immigration**: arrival of individuals from outside the population
- **Emigration**: departure of individuals from the population

**Growth rate formula**: =  (Crude birth rate + immigration rate) - (Crude death rate + emigration rate) = Growth rate


## Limiting factors restrain growth
**Limiting factors**: physical, chemical and biological characteristics that restrain population growth
- water, space, food, predators, and disease
**Environmental resistance**: All limiting factors taken together\
**Carrying capacity**: the maximum population size of a species that its environment can sustain\
**Logistic growth curve**: S-shaped curve used to model population growth


## Reproductive strategies
(on exam 1)

**Biotic potential**: the ability (maximum capacity) of an organism to produce offspring (under ideal environmental conditions). (Fish vs whales)

- **k-selected species**: animals with long gestation periods and few offspring
  - Have a low biotic potential
  - Stabilize at or near carrying capacity
  - Good competitors
- **r-selected species**: animals which reproduce quickly
  - Have a high biotic potential–Little parental care
